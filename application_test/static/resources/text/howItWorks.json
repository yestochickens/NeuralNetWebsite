    "p1": "In recent years, machine learning and artificial intelligence have gained a massive surge in interest. The general public is now fully aware of the limitless possibilities provided by this growing technology. Breakthroughs such as the innovation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have worked to improve performance issues of the past, while creations like GPT-3 have demonstrated the vast scale of said models. What is even more amazing (frightening to some) is that there is still so much left to explore and develop in machine learning. This has opened the public to discussion/debate on how the emerging technology should be used, making AI a topic of major contention.",
